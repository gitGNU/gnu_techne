Closing the Lua state on exit:
==============================

Closing the Lua state calls all finalizers on exit and frees memory
resources.  Normaly only entirely unlinked nodes can be collected but
this doesn't hold on exit, therefore heap corruption if a node's
linkage changes and one of the nodes it points to has been collected.
This needs to be addressed if closing the Lua state on exit proves
necessary.

Porting/cross-compiling:
========================

* graphics.window is initially {0, 0}
* win32 port crashes when trying to set window size
* version number should be augmented by platform if possible.
* autoconf check for whether the terminal supports color output.

Techne can be configured for cross-compiling like this:

LUA_CFLAGS='-I/usr/local/mingw/include' LUA_LIBS='-L/usr/local/mingw/lib -llua -lm' MHD_CFLAGS='-I/usr/local/mingw/include' MHD_LIBS='-L/usr/local/mingw/lib -lmicrohttpd' ./configure --build=x86_64-linux-gnu --host=i686-pc-mingw32

TODO (eventually):
==================

* Fix the manual page.
* Make network page functions return {mime, page} instead of page.
* Consider moving luaarray, luaprompt to github.
* Consider automatically invoking the GDB when something goes wrong.

TODO (ASAP):
============

* Need debug meshes for the following items (remeber to delete traverse methods):
  - Plane
  - Racetrack

* Fix the chain node to properly reflect the velocity when the run changes.
* Add a Lua texture object wrapper.
