Porting/cross-compiling:
========================

* graphics.window is initially {0, 0}
* win32 port crashes when trying to set window size
* version number should be augmented by platform if possible.
* autoconf check for whether the terminal supports color output.

Techne can be configured for cross-compiling like this:

LUA_CFLAGS='-I/usr/local/mingw/include' LUA_LIBS='-L/usr/local/mingw/lib -llua -lm' MHD_CFLAGS='-I/usr/local/mingw/include' MHD_LIBS='-L/usr/local/mingw/lib -lmicrohttpd' ./configure --build=x86_64-linux-gnu --host=i686-pc-mingw32

TODO (eventually):
==================

* Fix the manual page.
* Make network page functions return {mime, page} instead of page.
* Consider moving luaarray, luaprompt to github.

TODO (ASAP):
============

* Need debug meshes for the following items (remeber to delete traverse methods):
  - Plane
  - Racetrack

* Need debug diagrams for joints.
  - Remove Joint->debug once this is done.

* Resolve naming conflicts in arraymath.
* Fix the chain node to properly reflect the velocity when the run changes.

Input
=====

* Fix Gdk event extraction and dispatch.
* Move Gdk event extraction to the Graphics node.
* Figure out event node packaging.
