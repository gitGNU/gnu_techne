Techne 0.3

Techne is a general purpose, programmable physical simulator and
renderer.  It reads in a set of scripts wherein every aspect of a
physical system is specified and then proceeds to simulate and render
the system onscreen.  This is the general idea.  The main goal is to
decouple computer programming, in its involved low-level form at
least, from digital art creation thus shifting effort away from
worrying about graphics library quirks and memory allocation and
towards understanding and modelling the physical and aesthetic aspects
of a given system.  This can't be accomplished if you have to recreate
the underlying framework for each separate task though.  The secondary
goal therefore is to design the system in such a way that new
features, for instance physical models or shading algorithms, can be
added and accumulated seamlessly, implemented with the least possible
assumptions about their intended use so that they may be reused in
diverse situations.
